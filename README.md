# Splitties

Splitties is a collection of small independent Android libraries that aims
to make developing apps and libraries for Android (including Wear, TV,
Things, Auto and ChromeOS targeted) easier and more `fun`.

Some modules are similar to what [Anko](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko)
provides.

This project is named "Splitties" because it is split in small modules,
distributed as independent Android libraries, so you can add only the ones
you need to your project/module, helping reduce the size of the final apk.

Each module has been designed to have a small footprint and be as efficient
as possible.

## Download
**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The 2.0.0-alpha1 version is is pending jcenter sync.
That means that for the time being, you need to add the bintray repo manually.

To do so, add the following config snippet to your root project `build.gradle`
file:
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://dl.bintray.com/louiscad/maven" }
    }
}
```
Subscribe to [this issue](https://github.com/LouisCAD/Splitties/issues/22) to
know when it is on jcenter.

#### Gradle instructions
Make sure you have `jcenter()` in the repositories defined in your project's
(root) `build.gradle` file (default for new Android Studio projects).

Add the version of the library to not repeat yourself if you use multiple
artifacts, and make sure their versions are in sync by adding an ext property
into your root project `build.gradle` file:
```groovy
allProjects {
    ext {
        splitties_version = '2.0.0-alpha1'
    }
}
```
Here are all the artifacts of this library. Just use the ones you need:

## What is a split
A "split" is a module of the Splitties library that you can add as a
dependency. It only includes the required transitive dependencies.
This allows you to only add what you need in your app or library module,
so the final apk is as small as possible and doesn't include stuff not used
by your app.

Let's say you're build an Android Wear app using the View DSL.
Android Wear apps don't need AppCompat. Including it would be a waste of
bandwidth and storage. The View DSL core module relies on the Android
SDK but not on AppCompat, so you don't bloat your wrist app with AppCompat
by using View DSL. However, if you are building a phone, tablet or computer
Android app, there's a View DSL AppCompat split with a few extensions for
you to use.
